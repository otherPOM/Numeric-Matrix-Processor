# Numeric Matrix Processor https://hyperskill.org/projects/60

## Stage 1
In this stage, you should write a program that:

1. Reads matrix ***A*** from the input.
2. Reads matrix ***B*** from the input.
3. Outputs their sum if it is possible to add them. Otherwise, it should output the `ERROR` message.

Each matrix in the input is given in the following way: the first line contains the number of rows n and the number of columns m. Then n lines follow, each containing m integers representing one row of the matrix.

Output the result in the same way but don't print the dimensions of the matrix.
