# Numeric Matrix Processor https://hyperskill.org/projects/60

## Stage 1
In this stage, you should write a program that:

1. Reads matrix ***A*** from the input.
2. Reads matrix ***B*** from the input.
3. Outputs their sum if it is possible to add them. Otherwise, it should output the `ERROR` message.

Each matrix in the input is given in the following way: the first line contains the number of rows n and the number of columns m. Then n lines follow, each containing m integers representing one row of the matrix.

Output the result in the same way but don't print the dimensions of the matrix.

## Stage 2
Write a program that:
1. reads a matrix and a constant,
2. outputs the result of their multiplication.

## Stage 3
In this stage, you should write a program that can do all operations on matrices that you've learned.

Write a program that does the following:

1. Prints a menu consisting of 4 options. The example shows what the menu should look like.
2. Reads the user's choice.
3. Reads all data (matrices, constants) needed to perform the chosen operation. The example shows the input format in each case.
4. Calculates the result and outputs it. The example shows how your output should look like.
5. Repeats all these steps.

The program should keep repeating this until the `"Exit"` option is chosen.

If some operation cannot be performed, output a warning message.

## Stage 4
In this stage, you should add an option to transpose matrices. If the user chooses this option, your program should provide them with 4 types of transposition and ask them to choose one. Then it should read the matrix, transpose it, and output the result. Refer to the example to see the exact format.

Note that your program should still be able to do all operations on matrices that you've implemented in the previous stage.
